.Tsteady-state creep through dislocation climb ..Aweertman,j..Bj.app. phys. 28, 1957, 362..Wsteady-state creep through dislocation climb .  a dislocation climb creep model is considered which does not requirethe production of immobile dislocations .  the creep equation thatresults from the analysis iswhere a and b are constants, is the stress, q is the activation energyof creep and kt has its usual meaning .  this equation is quite similarto one previously proposed .
