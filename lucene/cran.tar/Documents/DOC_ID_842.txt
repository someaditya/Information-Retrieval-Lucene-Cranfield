.Tan improvement on donnell's approximation for thin-walledcircular cylinders ..Amorley,l.s.d..Bq. j. mech. app. math. 12, 1959..Wan improvement on donnell's approximation for thin-walledcircular cylinders .  donnell's equation for thin-walled circular cylinders is replaced bywhere w is a non-dimensional form of the radial displacement and q isthe distributed radial loading .  this equation retains the essentialsimplicity of the original but, unlike donnell's equation, the accuracydoes not decrease as the wavelength of circumferential distortionincreases .
