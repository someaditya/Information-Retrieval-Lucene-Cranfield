.Tbuckling of circular cones under axial compression ..Alackman,l. and penzien,j..Bj. app. mech. 27, 1960, 458..Wbuckling of circular cones under axial compression .presented are the results of an experimentalinvestigation to determine the bucklingstrength of right circular cones under axialcompression .  correlation of these data ismade with existing theory and with previouslypublished experimental data on circularcylinders,. thus a recommended procedurefor predicting the buckling load of rightcircular cones under the foregoing loadingcondition is presented .
