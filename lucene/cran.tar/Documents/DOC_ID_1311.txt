.Tsome simple solutions to the problem of predictingboundary layer self-induced pressures ..Abertram,m.h. and blackstock,t.a..Bnasa tn.d798, 1961..Wsome simple solutions to the problem of predictingboundary layer self-induced pressures .  simplified theoretical approachesare shown, based on hypersonicsimilarity boundary-layer theory,which allow reasonably accurateestimates to be made of the surfacepressures on plates on which viscouseffects are important .  the considerationof viscous effects includesthe cases where curved surfaces,stream pressure gradients, andleading-edge bluntness are important factors .
