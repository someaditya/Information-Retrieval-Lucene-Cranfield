.Tfree-flight techniques for high speed aerodynamic research ..Ahamilton,j.a. and hufton,p.a..Bj.roy.ae.s. 60, 1956, 151..Wfree-flight techniques for high speed aerodynamic research .  the development rocket-borne and rocket-launched high-speedairplane model test is described .  details of airborne components,telemetering units, tracking, and their calibration are also discussed .tests on controls, drag measurements, longitudinal stabilityevaluations, lift measurements, pressure measurements, aeroelasticestimations, and sonic bang recordings are effected .  the reynolds numbersinvolved are much higher than are usual in the wind tunnel, andextensions of mach numbers are obtained beyond the tunnel limits, both freeof the tunnel wall interference .
