.Teffect of variable heat recombination on stagnationpoint heat transfer ..Afenster,s.j. and neyman,r.j..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962..Weffect of variable heat recombination on stagnationpoint heat transfer .  earlier studies assume an average heat of formation of atomsbased upon external flow conditions .  it is shown that equilibriumheat transfer decreases by 35 for a typical mach number 24 casewhen allowance is made for the proportions of air components .the variable recombination energy also results in atom massfractions which are realistically less for equilibrium than frozensituations throughout the cold-wall boundary layer .
