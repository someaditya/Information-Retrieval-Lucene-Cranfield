.Tboundary-layer interaction on a yawed infinite wing in hypersonicflow ..Arobert j. whalen.Bprincipal scientist, flight sciences laboratory, inc.,buffalo, n.y..Wboundary-layer interaction on a yawed infinite wing in hypersonicflow .the equations are given for the laminar boundary-layerequations on a yawed infinite wing for constantwall temperature, under the combined howorth andmangler transformation .  diagrams show the relativelysmall influence of yaw, the increase of boundary-layersecondary flow, and the variation of the local heattransfer rate with yaw .
